# Take Home Task for Plumguide

Recreated given design, it's not 1:1 since It was recreated just from a screenshot.

## Stack:

### Framework: NextJS + TS + next/image with Imgix for image performance

### Styling: styled-components

### Tests: No tests provided

### Custom document to provide SSR styles and inject them to the head

### Others

I've mocked some of the data into objects (to make it just a bit dynamic), and the index page would be actually presenting Product Page (PDP)
Slider is handled just by a front, (means after each refresh we lands every time at page 1, since our state is being refreshed)

- Page is actually SSG

## Deployed on Vercel

## Task was to recreate the given design, by using react

Also I've decided to add TS, as I was using it for most of the time.
